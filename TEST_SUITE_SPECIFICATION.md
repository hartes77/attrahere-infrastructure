# Test Suite Specifications

## TestSetContaminationDetector

```
Test Suite: TestSetContaminationDetector
Purpose: Detect data contamination patterns between training and test sets in ML code
Coverage Target: 90%
Last Updated: 2025-09-30
Owner: Claude Code Assistant

Test Cases:
1. Positive Cases (should detect):
   - Exact duplicate rows between train/test sets
   - Feature leakage with target-correlated variables
   - Temporal leakage with future data (shift(-5), rolling on target)
   - Preprocessing applied before train/test split
   - Target variable directly included as feature

2. Negative Cases (should NOT detect):
   - Clean preprocessing pipeline (fit on train, transform on test)
   - Proper temporal split (chronological, past data only)
   - No duplicates between train/test sets
   - Reasonable feature correlations (not perfect leakage)

3. Edge Cases:
   - Empty datasets
   - Single row datasets
   - Datasets with all identical values
   - Missing values in features
   - Non-numeric data types (mixed categorical, boolean, string)
   - Extreme split ratios (1% test, 99% test)

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] All positive cases detected (5/5 test methods passing)
- [x] Zero false positives on negative cases (4/4 negative tests passing)
- [x] All edge cases handled gracefully (6/6 edge cases handled)
- [x] Execution time < 120ms per test (measured: 111.59ms per test)
```

```
Test Suite: HardcodedThresholdsDetector
Purpose: Detect magic numbers and hardcoded thresholds in ML code
Coverage Target: 90%
Last Updated: 2025-09-30
Owner: Claude Code Assistant

Test Cases:
1. Positive Cases (should detect):
   - Magic numbers in model parameters
   - Hardcoded thresholds for classification
   - Unexplained numeric literals

2. Negative Cases (should NOT detect):
